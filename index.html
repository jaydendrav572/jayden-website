    <h2>History</h2>
    <p> Inglewood was founded in 1875, in a forest clearing. Inglewood was originally named Moatown before being changed to Milton, then being changed to Inglewood to avoid confusion between the Milton in the South Island.  In 1876 the New Plymouth Railway reached Inglewood and the Inglewood Railway Station was born. In the 2000s the Inglewood Railway Station became New Zealand’s oldest station still in its original place. In 1924 the town’s war memorial ‘the sorrowing soldier’ was made. Behind it is a rhododendron, claimed to be the biggest in the Southern Hemisphere.
From 1952 to 1972, Inglewood held the ‘greatest show on earth.’ It was a gala that could have up to 35,000 people featuring events like parades, races, circus acts, wood chopping and more. Te Kohanga Moa Marae is located in Inglewood. It is affiliated with the Te Āti Awa hapū of Pukerangiora.
